## TOOLS USED

This project leverages a range of powerful tools to efficiently collect, clean, analyze, and visualize sales data:

- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for initial data exploration, cleaning, and transformation, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
- **SQL**: Employed for querying and managing data from relational databases, facilitating data extraction and transformation.
- **Power BI**: Utilized to build interactive dashboards and visualizations, providing insights through dynamic reports.
- **LINEAR REGRESSION CALCULATOR and PYTHON**: Used for linear regression and predictive analysis
- **DATATAB and EVIEWS**: Employed for Statistical Analysis

These tools collectively enabled seamless data management and visualization, ensuring accurate reporting and informed decision-making.

## DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION

The data cleaning process for the sales analysis project involved several key steps to ensure the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis:

- Data Collection: The initial dataset was received from the Ladies in Tech Initiative, ensuring all relevant sales information was included.
- Data Inspection: A thorough review of the dataset was conducted to identify any discrepancies, missing values, or outliers that could affect the analysis.
- Standardization: Data formats were standardized, including date formats and categorical values, to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
- Duplicate Removal: Duplicate entries were identified and removed to avoid skewed analysis results.
- Data Validation: Final checks were performed to confirm the accuracy of data entries and to ensure that all values fell within expected ranges.
- Data Loading: Data was loaded into analytics tools for analysis

By following these steps, the dataset was cleaned and optimized for accurate analysis, leading to reliable insights and actionable recommendations.
